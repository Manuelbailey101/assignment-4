            <h2>MY LIFE</h2>
            <p>Born in <bold>virginia</bold> he was a quiet kid , especially since school was his least favorite thing to go to . when he was little he's always had his toys he wanted to play with ,his Vroom Vroom , his WWe superstars, and his chicken little toys. He's always been an easy kid to please , never asked for too much but always asked for enough. eventually his dad would get orders to georgia where he would meet one of his favorite teachers and have some of his favorite friends. Manuel was a straight A student when it came to school . always came to school ontime , never was late, always turned in assignments , was nice , and was an awesome listener . </p>

            <h2>🕯️MY FAVORITE THINGS🕯️</h2>
            <P>since i was young i used to love drawing portaits , animals, or even just copying people on youtube and trying my best to make it look as identical as possible. My dad got me into games starting with the gamecube , im used to just play the teen titans game 24/7. Then as i got older i started getting into the playstation games like COD , 2k, and Madden . Some of my favorite things to outside of the house would be going to watch Marvel movies , doing MMA , and going on runs .</P>
